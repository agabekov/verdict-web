## 7. In‑App Purchases, Subscriptions, and Donations

### StoreKit Integration

The App offers optional in‑app purchases (including subscriptions and voluntary tips) processed through Apple’s StoreKit.

### Subscriptions

Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (each a "Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a regular cadence, typically monthly or yearly, depending on the plan you select.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the same conditions unless you cancel. You may cancel your Subscription renewal in the Subscriptions section of the App Store on your device. Because all billing is handled by Apple, Verdict cannot view, manage, refund, or otherwise modify your Subscription.

All amounts paid are non‑refundable. You are responsible for any applicable taxes, fees, currency conversions, or charges levied by your financial institution or intermediaries. Unless otherwise displayed in the App at the time of purchase, prices are shown in U.S. Dollars.

### Free Trial

From time to time, Verdict may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period ("Free Trial"). You may be required to sign in with your Apple ID and provide billing details to start a Free Trial. If you start a Free Trial, you will not be charged until the trial period ends. On the last day of the Free Trial, unless you cancel your Subscription, Apple will charge the applicable Subscription amount and your plan will continue automatically.

We reserve the right to modify the terms of any Free Trial or to cancel a Free Trial offer at any time without notice.

### Fee Changes

Verdict may modify Subscription fees at any time. Any change to Subscription pricing will take effect at the end of your then‑current Billing Cycle. We will provide reasonable prior notice of any change to give you an opportunity to cancel before the change becomes effective. Your continued use of the Service after a fee change takes effect constitutes your agreement to pay the updated amount.

### Tips/Donations

The App may also offer optional tips to support development (for example, a coffee or wine tip). Tips are voluntary, processed by Apple, and are non‑refundable.

### Payment Terms

- All purchases are processed by Apple and are subject to Apple’s terms and policies
